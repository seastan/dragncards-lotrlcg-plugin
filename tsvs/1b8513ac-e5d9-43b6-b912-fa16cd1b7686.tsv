They have crossed the River secretly and are moving westward. They have taken the guise of riders in black.” — Radagast, The Fellowship of the Ring In June of T.A. 3018, Radagast travels from Rhosgobel to warn Gandalf of the reappearance of the Nazgûl. Before leaving, he sends forth his birds, bringing the same warning to you and your allies. He requests that you aid him and Gandalf by thwarting the movements and designs of the Black Riders.

Quest Phase All cards on the Middle-earth Map contribute their [threat] except for locations on your current region. Those locations are considered to be active, and progress must first be placed on them (distributed in any way) before it is placed on the current quest. Travel Phase You cannot travel to locations. During the travel phase, as an action, the first player may move the progress token marking your group’s current region to a neighboring region (north, east, south, or west). The first time this action is triggered each round, there is no cost. To trigger it additional times in a round, the first player must remove 3[pp] progress tokens from the main quest. Encounter Phase Only enemies that were on the same region as you at any point during the round can be optionally engaged, and only those enemies will make engagement checks. Immunity Enemies and locations that are not on your current region are immune to player card effects.

To investigate rumors, a player in your group must control at least 1 ready character. If your group is able to investigate rumors, your group must do so. If no players in your group have any ready characters, your group cannot investigate rumors and this text is ignored. To begin, any player exhausts 1 character they control and discards the top X cards from the encounter deck, where X is that character’s highest attribute ([willpower], [attack], or [defense]). Set aside any discarded cards with a Rumor effect. The same or another player may repeat this process any number of times, with an action window occurring between discarding the cards and exhausting another character. Once the players decide to stop exhausting characters, they must choose 1 Rumor effect among the set-aside cards, if any. Then, discard those set-aside cards and resolve the chosen Rumor effect. There is no penalty if no Rumor effects are found. Rumor effects are ignored when the players are not investigating rumors.

Chris begins by exhausting a Defender of Rammas, whose highest attribute is its 4 [defense], and discards the top 4 cards of the encounter deck. Chris finds a Rumor effect among the discarded cards, and sets that card aside. Instead of resolving that effect, Chris decides to ready Boromir, whose highest attribute is also 4 [defense] thanks to an attached Gondorian Shield, and exhausts him to discard 4 more encounter cards. Chris finds another Rumor effect among these cards and sets that card aside as well. Chris or another player could continue to exhaust more characters to look for more, but the players decide that they are happy with the first Rumor effect and choose it. They discard both set-aside cards, then resolve the chosen Rumor effect. The effect says “The first player engages this enemy. Choose either the region north or south of your region and place 1 resource token on it.” After the first player engages the card with this Rumor effect, the group, which is in Enedwaith, chooses the region to the immediate south of their current region (The Outlands) and places 1 resource token on it.

Forced: After a location is explored (and before triggering that location’s Forced effect), each player may ready a character they control. Hard Mode Each player cannot reduce their threat by more than 1 each round. Forced: After a location is explored (and before triggering that location’s Forced effect), all players must resolve the shadow effect of the bottommost Nazgûl enemy in the encounter discard pile. Then, place that enemy on the top of the discard pile. Epic Multiplayer Mode This quest can be played by up to 9 groups of players, with 1-4 players per group. Each group must have their own copy of the quest and plays their own separate game. Unless a card effect specifically mentions the other groups, cards only affect the game in which they are played. Once the game has begun, each group can play at their own pace.

A: The passive text on enemies is active immediately and will place them on a region at the very beginning of the reveal process. So unless that region is your current region, the enemies will be immune to effects like Thalin’s ability. However, the Forced effect on locations that places them on a region triggers only after the card has entered play. Therefore a card like The Door is Closed or Warden of Arnor could be used, even if that location is going to be placed on a region other than your current region. Q: Can I play cards into the staging area? A: Yes. When a card is added to the staging area and does not specify a region to put it on, such as a player side quest, place it next to the Middle-earth Map. You can also play attachments on cards in the staging area, such as Ancient Mathom or The Road Goes Ever On, provided their targets aren’t immune to player card effects. Q: How does the Burglar’s Turn Contract work in The Nine are Abroad? A: Since you never actually travel to locations, it will never trigger. If you wish to create a house rule, you could trigger it on a location in your current region at the end of the travel phase if you moved regions that phase.
