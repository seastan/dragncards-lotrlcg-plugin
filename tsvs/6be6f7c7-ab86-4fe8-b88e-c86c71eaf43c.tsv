This quest captures the entirety of Bilbo’s adventures in The Hobbit, from the unexpected party at Bag End all the way through the Battle of the Five Armies. Component Overview The Hobbit scenario includes 106 cards, consisting of:  • 3 Rules Cards • 6 Quest Cards  • 1 Hero Card • 1 Player Card  • 2 Contract Cards • 73 Encounter Cards  • 13 Boon Cards • 6 Burden Cards  • 1 Promo Hero Card Expansion Symbol The cards in The Hobbit scenario can be identified by this symbol before each card’s collector number. Estimated Play Time The Hobbit scenario covers most of the major events of the novel of the same name, and is therefore longer than a typical scenario. The estimated play time is approximately 90 + 30[pp] minutes.

In order to capture this in quest form, the scenario takes on a unique structure where each quest stage has its own set of encounter cards (denoted by their Stage X trait). These cards are divided into separate piles during setup. After the first planning phase, the players will reveal the 2-sided Adventure objective, which drives the progression through the quest stages. When the “We Must Away” side of the Adventure objective is revealed, all encounter cards related to the current stage are returned to their pile, and the next stage’s pile is used to create an encounter deck for the next stage (after setting aside any unique cards). The players spend a first round on the new stage, at the end of which the Adventure objective is flipped to its “Waylaid” side, and a Plight objective is revealed. The players then spend a second round at the stage dealing with the Plight objective. At the end of that second round, the Resolution effects will trigger, rewarding you if you have done well at the stage or punishing you if you have not. The Adventure objective is flipped back to “We Must Away”, revealing it and advancing the quest again.

Stage 5 is resolved entirely during the end of the round and will remove the Adventure objective from the game. The final stage, The Battle of the Five Armies, is played without the time pressure of this objective. Players should prepare for a variety of challenges as they progress, including unique treacheries, locations, and enemies tailored to each stage. Careful planning and adaptation will be key to overcoming the dangers that lie ahead. Resolution Effects The Resolution effect on cards in this scenario is only resolved when a card effect instructs you to do so. The Baggins Sphere The Baggins ([baggins]) sphere on Bilbo Baggins functions the same as in the FFG The Hobbit Saga scenarios. Bilbo Baggins’s pool can be used by the player controlling him to play neutral or [baggins] cards from their hand. While there are no new [baggins] player cards included in this product, players are free to include [baggins] cards from the FFG The Hobbit Saga scenarios in their decks.

Boons Area The boons area is a separate game area next to the staging area. Cards in the boons area are in play, but are not controlled by any player. Exhausted cards in the boons area ready at the beginning of each refresh phase. Earning a Boon To “earn” a boon card, add it to the boons area. The Letter B As indicated by the “Terms” objective, the letter B in various card effects in this scenario refers to the current number of boons in the boons area. The players will find that as they collect more boons the difficulty increases, and as they use their boons the difficulty decreases. Instead of this scenario including an easy or hard mode, it offers a challenge: try to win with as many boons as you can! If you win with at least 10 boons in play, you earn the right to start any future scenario with Master Burglar in play. And for those looking for a nightmare-level challenge, try to win with all 13 boons in play!

Example 1: In a 3 player game, by triggering the Planning Action of Riddles in the Dark, “Wind” is added to the victory display. The first player exhausts Gríma (accents are ignored) and Forest Snare. They lack 2 letters, so they raise their threat by 2. The second player exhausts Windfola, and does not lack any letters. The third player decides not to exhaust any cards, so they raise their threat by 4. Note that you can only exhaust characters or attachments you control. You cannot exhaust contracts, side quests, boons, etc. Example 2: In a 2 player game, by triggering the Planning Action of Riddles in the Dark, “Mountain” is added to the victory display. The first player exhausts Dáin Ironfoot and Miruvor, containing all 8 letters, so they do not raise their threat. The second player exhausts only Nori. Since they lack 5 letters, they raise their threat by 5.

What about while resolving Barrels out of Bond (5A) or Smaug’s Hoard (5B)? A: Riddles in the Dark has a Planning Action which can be triggered at any point during the planning phase. Therefore players are able to play cards and trigger actions between revealing cards. There are no action windows during the resolution of 5A or 5B. Q: During setup, can Master Burglar attach to a Bilbo Baggins hero that has been made into a hero with Messenger of the King?  A: No. Assuming a player has met the requirements, Master Burglar is put into play when starting heroes are put into play, which is before Messenger of the King resolves. Q: Can Master Burglar be included in a deck by a player that has not won The Hobbit with 10 or more boons in play?  A: Yes, any player can include Master Burglar in their deck and play it like any other attachment. Note that a player will not benefit from the starting threat reduction in this case.
