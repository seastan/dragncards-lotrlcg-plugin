The Aldburg Plot Difficulty level = 5 In the darkness: “Do what you are bidden, Ossian.” The soldier grimaced. “My lord, he is one of us. I fought at his side at Amon Hen. He saved my life.” “Remember what we are fighting for, my boy. Go now. For the Gift.” He steeled himself. “For the Gift.” Late that night, the heroes were roused from an unsteady sleep by Ealdwulf himself. The crags of his face were licked by shadow. All else was darkness. “It is not yet dawn,” he said. “I have ill news.” “What tidings, master Ealdwulf?” said one of the heroes. “A rider of Rohan has turned himself in,” said the old lord.

For treason.” The word hit like a hammer. “He has told the guards that the rest of his comrades will move to depose Lord Éomund before dawn. That even our trusted spy master has turned against us in service of a devilish conspiracy.” “We must go to the guards,” said a hero, lacing her hauberk. “Perhaps we can wring some details from this prisoner.” “I feel the noose ever-tightening,” said Ealdwulf. “The traitors are within the walls now. Better not to tip our hand that we have become aware of their duplicity. My friends, root out this treason, or the Eastmark shall surely crumble from within – and with it, the soul of Rohan.” With that, the heroes outfitted themselves and made their way to the quiet streets of Aldburg. “Shall we go to the barracks, then?” said one. As they passed by a seamy tavern called The Horse’s Tail, they caught a whisper of hushed conversation. “Assassin?” said one of the patrons. “In Aldburg?” “Tavern or barracks,” said a hero. “Shall we toss a coin?”

(Faithless Rohirrim and Rohan Encampment can be found in the Children of Eorl deluxe expansion.) These sets are indicated by the following icons: Racing into the halls of Lord Éomund, the heroes were greeted by the young Marshal. He wore a scowl on his face, his blade unsheathed across his lap. Beside him sat the wizened Ealdwulf, his eyes bleary and sleepless. At the heroes’ entrance, the old man leapt to his feet. “What news?” said Ealdwulf. “Come, what news?” “Yes,” said Éomund. “Tell us which captain’s head shall be cloven, and let us be done with it.” “Patience, my lord.” Ealdwulf knelt at his lord’s feet. “Surely they have found something. Friends, tell us what you have learned.”

How came it into the spy master’s possession?” “Perhaps a token from the warchief to one of his traitorous collaborators,” said Ealdwulf. If the heroes control the Silver Dagger objective: “I recognize this blade,” said Ealdwulf. “As do I,” said one of the heroes. “At Erelas, Gálmód wielded it against a captive Dunlending. I thought perhaps it was a fit of rage, but is it possible he meant only to silence a man who could have betrayed his secret?” If the heroes control the Rohirric Coins objective: “What’s the meaning of these coins?” said one of the heroes. “A stranger dropped them for us in the tavern.” “Perhaps he mistook you for one of the Whisperer’s agents,” said Éomund. “Your appearance is strange enough.” If the heroes control the Prison Key objective: “You retrieved this from the spy master, then?” said Éomund. “So we can be certain he was behind the prisoner’s murder. Does this conspiracy extend further?” If the heroes control the Ruby Cloak-pin objective: “We found this among the ashes in the western quarter,” said one of the heroes. “We know it well. This belonged to Gálmód. But of him we have found no trace.”

Our pact remains unfulfilled. Return the land of green hills to my people, as you have oathsworn. Grimrede.” If the heroes control the Traitor’s Confession objective: “The killer Ossian was one of Gálmód’s most trusted lieutenants,” said Ealdwulf. “Doubtless he hoped to eliminate the prisoner before he spoke the truth of what happened at Erelas.” If the heroes control the Red Fletched Arrow objective: “The armorer claims he was instructed to create this for Gálmód,” said one of the heroes. “What could this be for?” “It was meant for his assassin’s bow,” said Éomund. “And my heart.” Conclusion: With your evidence laid before the Marshal, the young lord Éomund summons his guards. “Bring me Gálmód in chains. He will not live to see morning.” The story continues in “Fire on the Eastemnet”, the second Adventure Pack in the “Oaths of the Rohirrim” cycle.
