The Gap of Rohan Difficulty level = 6 They rode west at once, fording at the Entwade, their faces grim, their steeds panting. After his treachery at Aldburg, the coward Gálmód had fled into the countryside, traveling by night to escape Rohan and the wrath of the marshal, lord Éomund. Now he had been spotted crossing the Snowbourn, only some days ahead, as he broke across the hills of the Westfold for the Gap of Rohan and the wilderness beyond. “He shall not escape,” said one of the heroes. “He shall answer for his treason.” “Such was our oath,” said another. Here and there the landscape became hilly and steep before opening to vast fields of grass and long, wide valleys. A cool air swept up from the White Mountains

The riders did not stop. They did not stop when the road grew violet and dusky, nor when the sun fell behind the Hornburg and drenched the land in shadow. They did not stop for the patrolling éored riding by torchlight, for the heroes knew among themselves that Gálmód’s conspiracy was more enormous than they had yet seen, a great web spanning the armies of Rohan and her royal halls, from the west and the east, from without and within. A soldier of the Rohirrim hailed the heroes and they rode on, silent as shadows. It was three days before they found his trail, some miles past the great fortress at Helm’s Deep where the king of old had waged bitter war against the Dunlendings. Three days of tireless vigil, of stomachs empty as stones, of aching thighs, of horses with eyes black as marbles and wild as a nightmare. As they rode it felt as if seasons passed; the warm weather which they had enjoyed so well now faded with every hoofbeat. Summer was gone, then autumn, and they could feel upon the air a great stillness, and dread accumulated among them for each could feel the building of a cold storm, a cruel storm, a ragged and vicious blizzard awaiting them.

The storm closed upon them like a great white mouth, buffeting them, threatening to tear the very cloaks from their shoulders. The snow fell in an incredible white haze such that each hero could not see the nose of his own horse. “Gálmód has no care for himself,” shouted a hero. “He rides to his death.” “This is no ordinary storm,” said another. “He is driven by terror.” Onward and on, and soon they found themselves in the great Gap of Rohan. Behind them lay the wide gorgeous lands of the Horse-lords, to the left the White Mountains, to the right the Misty Mountains from which oft descended goblins and hungry orcs. Ahead lay Dunland, where Gálmód would surely find shelter amid his confederates. Within the hour the snow had risen to their knees. Some miles before them in the distance, the traitor ran fleetingly into the cold and sudden white. “Ride on,” said a hero. “After you,” replied another. “For oath and honor.”

(Faithless Rohirrim and Rohan Weather can be found in the Children of Eorl deluxe expansion.) These sets are indicated by the following icons: Frostbite X Frostbite is a new keyword in The Gap of Rohan. The frostbite keyword represents the effects of the worsening storm, as the heroes struggle to press onward despite lacking the proper provisions. When a card with the frostbite keyword is in play, each player must exhaust X characters at the beginning of the round, where X is that card’s frostbite value.

All about them was a wilderness of snow and stone, a fierce blizzard threatening to rip even the mountains from their roots. A few of the Dunlendings threw down their arms with such force that the blades and spears vanished into the snowbanks. Others scattered upon horseback, weaving crooked trails to the west and north. Those who remained were bound roughly. “We ought to get them out of the cold,” said one of the heroes. “They may be brigands and brutes, but they ought not freeze to death.” “There is no shelter,” said another. “The nearest perhaps is the Glittering Caves which run beneath these mountains, beneath the king’s old fortress at Helm’s Deep.” “We’ve no choice. Come, where is Gálmód? Bring him before us.” The traitor had been lying in a snowbank, and at the mention of his name he stirred. “I was a fool,” said

The flesh on his hands and cheeks and nose was a pale, unnerving purple. “A fool to betray your people,” said one of the heroes. “You bartered the beacon at Erelas to the Dunlendings. The life of Queen Morwen. The seat of Lord Éomund and the throne of his liege. Each of these you’ve forsworn, and with each betrayal you’ve sullied your house for a generation.” “I did. I was,” said Gálmód. “But the hill-folk. The Gift. I sought to help them. This is not our land. I only sought…he used them. He used me. Please, there isn’t much time. Please.” “There will be no talking your way out of this,” said one of the heroes, hoisting the captive to his feet. “We’ll get to shelter. And when this storm passes, we shall take you back to Edoras for trial.” The traitor Gálmód looked up for the first time and the heroes saw him perhaps for the first time as he truly was. He was afraid. Beaten. A shivering animal, his ice-blue eyes bloodshot and full of shame. He looked upon the heroes, and for a moment his expression softened. Then, his gaze fell behind the heroes.

His lungs wheezing, his eyes grew huge and fearful. Falling to his knees, he could not look away. The heroes turned and followed his gaze, and there upon a snowy bluff, backshot by a cold moon, his head bedecked in a horned helm of leather and gold, stood a man both tall and broad. His hands were bare, blackened by frostbite, his armor cracked and broken to reveal a body of dust and ice and ash. All about him the storm swirled, the man like a broken tower standing at its epicenter, looking down upon the party, his shriek delirious and violent and carried for miles by an endless, vengeful wind. The story continues in “The Glittering Caves”, the fourth Adventure Pack in the “Oaths of the Rohirrim” cycle.
