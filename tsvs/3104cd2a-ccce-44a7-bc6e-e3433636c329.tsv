The Glittering Caves Difficulty level = 7 A great gale blew across the Gap of Rohan and across the battlefield where the heroes had captured the traitor Gálmód. His Dunlending guard, what was left of them, had flung their blades into the snow and begged mercy in the guttural tongue of the hillmen. The rushing wind carried with it the sound of a dread shriek, a calamitous wailing which echoed darkly among the snowbanks. All turned, victor and captive, traitor and true, to the scream’s source. A single foe, standing lonesome on the ridge, its form at once spectral and fleshly. For such a thing could be naught but a foe, though decked in the garb of ancient Rohan. Its face was the pure spite of one cursed to wander after death, its seething scream a razor upon the very wind.

The Bane of Dunland. The Hammerhand. Helm is arisen and back to war.” Then the scream upon the wind became a growl, and the growl a voice so deep it rumbled the very roots of the mountains. “I smell the reek of Dunland.” It took a step forward, then another. “Come, traitors. Come, so I may feel your bones break beneath my fists.” At once the wind rose and pelted the heroes with ice. Soon none could see the person next to them. Nor could they see the king’s wraith as it stalked the storm, quiet and desolate as a shadow, moving among the snowblind captives, its fists tearing and smashing, the captives slumping one by one like broken dolls. When a body fell at Gálmód’s feet and the traitor looked up, he saw the perilous figure, the bitter king, raising his fists. “Fly!” cried one of the heroes. “Fly! The king is not himself. He is cursed with bloodlust.” “There is no shelter,” cried another. “We cannot defeat him with force of arms!” “There was a cave,” said the last. “I remember we passed a cave.”

Gálmód followed close behind the heroes. Driven by terror above all, the Dunlending captives scattered. Amid the blustering wind walked the wraith, implacable. They found the cave. A small crevice it was, which opened up to a vast chamber below, rife with stones which glinted and glimmered in the flicker of torchlight. “The Glittering Caves,” said one hero. “These tunnels lead all the way to the depths beneath the Hornburg and the fortress of Helm’s Deep. And where are our captives? Some of them no doubt skulk in the tunnels below. Fear has made them mad.” “We must press onward,” said another. “The wraith will not stop.” “It is said the king was unstoppable in battle, unleashed by the fury of his battle-horn. Perhaps if we can find it we may yet call him to his senses.” And so, the heroes went deeper, blades at the ready, and the snow piled behind them until the cave’s throat was a wall of ice, and the ghost of Lord Helm stalked the caves with his ears pricked for the sounds of men.

(Dunlending Warriors can be found in the Children of Eorl deluxe expansion.) These sets are indicated by the following icons: The Cave Card Type The 12 cards from the Exploring the Caves encounter set are “cave” cards, a new card type introduced in this scenario. Caves are immune to player card effects. Throughout the game, players move unique tokens representing themselves and Helm Hammerhand around a 4-by-3 grid of cave cards, called the Caves Map. When a player’s token is on a cave, that player and each character that player controls are considered to be at that cave. Travel actions on caves can only be performed by a player at that cave. Other game mechanics, like ranged and sentinel, function as normal, even while players are at different caves.

Diagonal caves are not adjacent. Two adjacent caves are also called connected if the artwork on their shared border shows a continuous path. Setting Up the Caves Map 1. Shuffle the caves together and deal them faceup in  a 4-across, 3-down grid in their own play area. 2. Starting with the first player, each player takes turns  swapping any 2 adjacent caves in the Caves Map.  The players may make up to 6 swaps in this way.  After the swaps, if any cave cannot be reached from  the top-left cave by a continuous path of connected  caves, raise each player’s threat by 1 and return to  step 1. Otherwise, proceed to step 3. 3. Each player places a unique player token on the  top-left cave (this does not count as moving to that  cave). These tokens can be anything as long as they  are different from the standard game tokens. Place  another unique token on the bottom-right cave. This  is Helm Hammerhand’s token and marks his current  cave.

To set up the clues: 1. Shuffle the 12 cards of the Search for the Horn  encounter set together to form the Clue Deck.  Look at the top 2[pp] cards, and place a resource  token on each cave indicated by name in the bottom  right corner of those cards. If all of the indicated  caves are in the left half of the Caves Map, remove  all resource tokens from the Caves Map and repeat  this step. 2. Remove the bottom card of the Clue Deck from the  game without looking at it. The cave indicated on  this card represents the secret whereabouts of  Helm’s Horn. 3. Shuffle the 11 remaining cards of the Clue Deck  together again and attach 1 card from it facedown  to each cave with a resource token. Then, remove  all resource tokens from the Caves Map. 4. Look at the remainder of the Clue Deck and place  a damage token on each indicated cave. These have  been ruled out as possible places for Helm’s Horn.  Shuffle the looked at cards into the encounter deck.

Typically, when players move, they must move to a connected cave. Helm Hammerhand, being a wraith, typically moves to an adjacent cave, regardless of whether that cave happens to be connected. If Helm Hammerhand is instructed to move toward the nearest player, and there exist multiple equidistant paths toward a nearest player, the first player decides which of those paths Helm Hammerhand will take. Caves Map Example Below is an example of what the Caves Map might look like in a 3 player game, after the clues have been placed.

It represents the players searching that cave for a clue to the whereabouts of Helm’s Horn, so that they can find the horn and sound it in Helm’s presence to quell the vengeful spirit. To “search this cave”, reveal the clue card attached to that cave as if it were revealed by the encounter deck. After resolving the staging of the clue card, place a damage token on the cave indicated in the clue card’s bottom right corner. You cannot search a cave if it has no attached clue. After all the clues have been revealed, only 1 undamaged cave will remain, corresponding to the card that was removed from the game during the Caves Map setup. Hard Mode The Glittering Caves has an additional difficulty mode called hard mode. To play in hard mode, during step 1 of setting up the clues, look at the top 10 cards of the Clues Deck instead of only the top 2[pp] cards.

His rageful face softened, and in the glittering light he resembled a man, tall and fair, as he appeared in the tapestries at Meduseld. “My sons are calling me home,” said Helm, his gaze weakening. “Onward, good Rohirrim. Onward to the Golden Hall for feast and fellowship. Onward, and drink to the end of suffering.” His gaze lingered upon Gálmód, an expression of pity perhaps, and sorrow. The traitor quavered. Tears welled in his eyes and he let out a single bitter sob. “My king!” he cried, reaching for the shade. But the king was gone, fading like a dream. Gálmód fell to his knees. “So passes Rohan,” he said. “For as her greatest king falls to ruin, so shall her people. Shades. Shades now are the Rohirrim. Shades of the people we could have been and shall never be again.” The story continues in “Mustering of the Rohirrim”, the fifth Adventure Pack in the “Oaths of the Rohirrim” cycle.
