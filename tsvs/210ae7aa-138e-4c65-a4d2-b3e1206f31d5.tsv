Multiple Stages and Main Quests In The Siege of Erebor, multiple stages are in play at the same time, with a main quest and staging area assigned to each. Each stage can also have a corresponding active location. At the beginning of the round, each player, starting with the first, chooses a stage. This will be their stage until the beginning of the next round. Different players may choose the same stage. Enemies engaged with a player remain engaged with that player even when their stage changes. When you play a card or apply the effects of a player card ability, only consider the players and cards at your stage as part of the game. This means that you cannot lower a player’s threat, play an attachment on a character, use the ranged keyword to declare or participate in an attack, etc., unless the cards or players involved share a stage with you.

West and East After setup, the 4 stages should be arranged in a line so that The Eastern Defenses is in the rightmost (“eastmost”) stage, and Erebor is in the leftmost (“westmost”) stage (see below). The term “eastmost stage” will refer to different stages throughout the game as stages leave play. Resolve each game step from west to east (whether there are players at that stage or not) before going on to the next game step. If a game step involves player order, resolve it in ascending player order of players at that stage. Note that when resolving a quest at a stage with no players, it is likely the quest will be unsuccessful; however, as there are no players at that stage, no one will increase their threat.

When a card moves west, it is added to the nearest staging area that is still in play to the left of its current stage, towards Erebor. Cards at the leftmost stage cannot move west. When a card moves east, it is added to the nearest staging area that is still in play to the right of its current stage, away from Erebor. Cards at the rightmost stage cannot move east. Revealing an Encounter Card In The Siege of Erebor, the rules for revealing an encounter card are modified slightly. When revealing an encounter card, any player at any stage can interact with it as normal. However, after being revealed, enemies and locations are added to the staging area of the stage indicated in the bottom-right corner of their card. If the stage indicated for an enemy or a location is not in play, discard that enemy or location without resolving its effects and instead deal 2 damage to the eastmost main quest.

From lowest to highest engagement cost, each  enemy in the staging area of the abandoned quest’s  stage moves west. 2. Discard each location at the abandoned quest’s stage  from play. Then, raise the threat of each player in the  game by the number of locations discarded. 3. Each player at the abandoned quest’s stage  immediately changes their stage to the nearest stage  to the west. Enemies engaged with a player remain  engaged with that player. If it is the quest phase,  committed characters become committed to the main  quest at the new stage (or to a side quest if it was the  current quest at the new stage). 4. Remove any other cards at the abandoned quest’s  stage (such as objectives or side quests) from the  game. The abandoned stage has now left play. 5. Add the abandoned quest to the victory display and  trigger the Forced effect on it. 6 Play resumes.

A: Player side quests are played into their controller’s staging area, and can be chosen as the current quest as normal by the first player in turn order at that stage. Q: Can I travel to locations or engage enemies at other stages? A: No, only at your stage. Q: Why are there 2 copies of Brand son of Bain? A: One copy uses the official card text. The other copy (identified by “FTCL” near its © text) uses modified text and Traits from ALeP’s Free to Choose List, an optional set of rules changes found on our website. Use whichever you prefer!
