Modular Scenario The Mirror of Galadriel is a modular scenario. Each playthrough will involve 4 modules: a scenario module, a villain module, a wave 1 module, and a wave 2 module. In this product, we provide a single scenario module and a villain module. The wave modules are constructed using other FFG and ALeP products, as indicated on the corresponding objective cards. A complete card pool is not necessary to play - just enough to construct a wave 1 and wave 2 module. In this product you will find 3 encounter sets. The first is The Mirror of Galadriel, which contains the objective cards that are used to incorporate the modules. The second is The Mirror of Galadriel - Gondor, corresponding to the scenario module. The third is The Mirror of Galadriel - Sauron, corresponding to the villain module. The icons for these encounter sets, respectively, are:

As a brief refresher, while the current quest has the defense keyword and the players quest successfully, they do not place progress (not even on an active location), but if they quest unsuccessfully, the first player places progress on the quest (with active locations as a buffer) equal to difference between the staging [threat] and committed [willpower]. New rule: While the main quest has the defense keyword, side quests cannot be chosen as the current quest. Turncoat The turncoat keyword first appeared in the Strange News in Bree scenario by ALeP, and the full rules for the keyword can be found in the associated rules. As a brief refresher, a character with turncoat loses their card type and tokens. They gain the enemy card type, their text box is considered blank, and they engage their former controller, with [threat] equal to their [willpower].

This means that during the travel phase, instead of the group choosing one location, each player without an active location may, in turn order, travel to a separate location. The word “you” in a location’s Travel cost refers only to the player travelling to it. After a player travels, the location is placed in their play area instead of next to the quest. Active locations still act as buffers for progress placed on the quest. The first player distributes that progress among active locations in any way they like. Progress may only go on the quest once all active locations are explored, unless they are explicitly bypassed. If a player card effect refers to “the active location”, it means the active location of the player that controls that card. Retreat X Retreat X represents your heroes falling back from their active location under enemy assault. When triggered, place X progress on your active location. If this exceeds that location’s quest points (or if you have no active location), place the excess directly on the main quest, bypassing other players’ active locations.

Deserter The deserter keyword is fully defined on Sauron’s card: characters with the deserter keyword lose their Traits. Earning a Boon The Mirror of Galadriel is a very difficult scenario, and players are not expected to win on the first attempt. Instead, players will earn boons during their attempts. When a player earns a boon, they choose a set-aside boon and put it into play, then record it in their own “Mirror log.” On your next playthrough of The Mirror of Galadriel, stage 1B instructs the players to put the boons in their Mirror log into play. A player’s Mirror log persists even if that player changes heroes. Some boons reference the number of boons you have earned—this always refers to a specific player’s Mirror log, not to the group.

At present, only one Villain objective exists, but future releases may require separate Mirror logs for each one. Easy Mode There are no cards removed for easy mode here, as the quest is designed to become easier as boons are earned. However, if players prefer an easier initial experience, or wish to avoid repeated playthroughs, they may use this easy mode rule: Ignore the Forced effect on Siege of Middle-earth during even-numbered rounds. Competitive Mode The Mirror of Galadriel supports an optional competitive mode. To begin, split the players into groups. Each group must choose the same Scenario and Villain objective. For the Wave objectives, each group can make their own selections freely or they can perform a draft among the Wave objectives where the groups are ordered randomly and each group must select a different wave. Reverse the order of the groups between Wave 1 and Wave 2 when drafting. If there are only 2 groups, they can also perform a draft where each group chooses the Wave objectives for the opposing group.

The winning group is determined as follows: 1. If only one group wins the scenario, they are the  overall winner. 2. If multiple groups win the scenario, the group with  the fewest progress on stage 4B is the overall winner. 3. If no group wins the scenario, each group divides the  damage on the Villain enemy by the number of  players in their group. The group with the highest  result is the winner. 4. If there is still a tie, select the groups that advanced  to the furthest quest stage. Among those groups,  the group with the fewest progress on their quest  stage is the winner. FAQ Q: When exactly does the Before Player Setup text of quest card 1A trigger during Setup? A: It triggers after players choose their starting heroes and assemble their decks, but before they start to resolve all the Setup text on their heroes and player cards. If you follow the Reworked Setup proposed by ALeP, this happens at the end of Step 2.

A: These two effects are in direct contradiction, so we look to the official FAQ item 1.14: “If a card effect uses the word ‘cannot’, then it is an absolute: that effect cannot be overridden by other effects.” Therefore, the enemy can indeed be affected. Q: Is a deserter character still considered to have printed Traits for card effects purposes, such as Tribute to the Dark Lord? A: Yes. When a card gains or loses traits due to a card effect, it does not alter what is actually printed on the card. Q: Can The One Ring player card (ASiTE 1) be used in this scenario? No, as this scenario provides its own version of The One Ring. However, players are free to use Master cards with the provided version.
