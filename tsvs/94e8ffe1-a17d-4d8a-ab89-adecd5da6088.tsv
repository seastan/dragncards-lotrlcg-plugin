Rules & New Terms The Bree-landers Deck When setting up Fangs in the Dark, the players are instructed to “create the Bree-landers deck”, which represents the heroes’ newfound ally Wolfsbane Jack and those friends he calls upon for aid. The Bree-landers deck is built using the cards in the Bree-landers encounter set, indicated by the icon below. To create the Bree-landers deck, place Wolfsbane Jack and the Bree-landers objective in a separate play area and shuffle the remaining cards from the Bree-landers set into a separate deck. This is the Bree-landers deck. When a card from the Bree-landers deck leaves play, it is removed from the game. If the Bree-landers deck runs out of cards, ignore any effects that refer to the Bree-landers deck.

Like any player, it contributes to the number of encounter cards revealed during the staging step and has its own play area. The Bree-landers player can be placed anywhere in the turn order during setup, but it cannot be chosen as or become the first player. When an effect would make it the first player, the first player token instead passes to the next player in turn order. Wolfsbane Jack and cards from the Bree-landers deck are considered to be player cards. Cards revealed from the Bree-landers deck are added to the Bree-landers play area and the Bree-landers player takes control of them. The first player makes all decisions that would normally be made by the Bree-landers player, including optionally engaging enemies as well as activating Actions and Responses. The Bree-landers player’s threat and threat elimination level are always considered to be equal to those of the first player. Any card effect that would increase the Bree-landers player’s threat is ignored. Bree-landers in Other Scenarios You can also try using the Bree-landers in place of a normal player when playing other scenarios, with a maximum of 4 players, including the Bree-landers player.

This is an unsupported play variant; some unintended rule conflicts may arise when playing in this way, and some ad hoc rulings might be required. We will propose a list of generic suggestions in this regard on our website. Previous Player The term “previous player” always refers to the previous counterclockwise player (from the current active player, or from the player who most recently performed a game function or passed) according to the player order. In a single-player game, there is no previous player, and card effects that target the previous player will not trigger. Fangs in the Dark Difficulty level = 7 Wolfsbane Jack was waiting for the heroes as they arrived at Bree’s West Gate, a blanket of stars spreading across the sky. His garments were simple, but well made, and lined with wolf-fur of various colors. His face was hard and worn from years spent in the wilderness, but despite his grim expression a quiet light of gentle kindness still flickered in his eyes.

We just came from there. Why do we return?” one asked. The hunter stroked his thick beard as he led the way. “The uprising we quelled in Bree today was the work of a cult called the Children of Gaur. I have tracked their movements for many months, watching their work take shape. They worship an ancient wolf-god, believing his return is nigh and that he will bestow power upon those who serve him.” One of the heroes scoffed. Jack nodded in agreement. “I put no faith in such tales. But evil done in the name of a false god is evil done nonetheless.” “To answer your question,” he continued, “from watching their comings and goings, I believe they have a hidden refuge somewhere near the Shire. You may have noticed more Men among those lands of late; they search for something. We must find their hiding place and uncover their aims.” “Ah,” said one of the heroes, putting it all together, “And their escaped lieutenant, Orc-eyes, will lead us to them! But how will we track him across such a well-worn path?”

We may receive news and aid from others upon the road. Tarry not! Each passing moment is a boon for our enemy.” “Fangs in the Dark” is played with an encounter deck built with all the cards from the following encounter sets: Fangs in the Dark, Bree-landers, Wolves, and Shire’s Edge. (Wolves and Shire’s Edge can be found in The Shire’s Reckoning deluxe expansion.) These sets are indicated by the following icons: “Stay your hand!” cried Jack. “We have need of Orc-eyes yet.” Seeing that he was bested, Orc-eyes dropped his sword with a clatter, spat a mouthful of blood on the ground, and warily raised his hands in surrender. “Well then, Wolfsbane,” he said, voice thick with contempt, “What now will you do?”

Your cult is shattered, your uprising failed.” “You think this was about Bree?” Orc-eyes laughed, low and mocking. “Bree was nothing; just a place to recruit for the cause.” Jack eyed him doubtfully. “The ‘cause,’ is it? You spun a tale from old myths, meant to lend honor to a gathering of thieves and murderers. That is no cause—it is treachery.” A dark smile spread across Orc-eyes’ face. “As ever, you grasp feebly in the dark, Wolfsbane. This did not begin with me, nor shall it end with you. Sixty years have the Children of Gaur labored, and the time of our ascendancy is at hand. You may deny him, but it is of no consequence. You need not believe in Gaur to feel his fangs at your throat.” “Sixty years?” One of the heroes interjected, looking more at her allies than at Orc-eyes. “There was another great wolf attack on the Shire some sixty years past, was there not?” “Aye… during the Fell Winter,” Jack confirmed, the slow light of realization playing behind his eyes. He turned to face Orc-eyes again. “You claim Gaur had a hand in that?”

Jack turned to his companions. “I do not hold with this talk of gods, but if the cult was behind the wolf attacks of old, then we must learn what was done to halt them. We may find some hint in the records at the Mathom House.” Then, without warning, everything changed: A soft swish, a sharp cry. Wolfsbane Jack staggered back, an arrow deep in his shoulder. For a heartbeat, silence reigned. Then, a great shout rose up from the woods further inland as several figures–some dressed in robes of purple–emerged from the inky darkness, brandishing weapons that flashed in the moonlight. Orc-eyes tripped and fell and scrambled away on all fours in the ensuing confusion. “Their refuge is here on Girdley Island!” One of the heroes shouted. “We have stumbled right into the heart of the wolves’ den!” The story continues in “The Brandywine Pursuit”, the third Adventure Pack in the “Fell Summer” cycle.
