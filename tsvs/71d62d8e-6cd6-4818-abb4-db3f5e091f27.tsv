Rules & New Terms Printed Characters & Enemies A card printed type is the card type printed in the type box below that card’s text box. A printed character refers to a card that has a printed card type that is either hero, ally, objective-hero, objective-ally, or ship-objective. A printed enemy refers to a card that has a printed card type that is either enemy or ship-enemy. Turncoat Turncoat is a new keyword introduced in the Fell Summer cycle and it represents the shifting allegiances of various characters and enemies.

The printed character’s controller loses control of it (and all attachments on it) and the encounter deck takes control of it (and all attachments on it). The printed character loses its printed card type, gains the enemy card type (with [threat] equal to its printed [willpower] and an engagement cost of 0) and engages its former controller. While a printed character has turncoat, its text box is considered to be blank (except for Traits). If a printed character loses turncoat while it’s still in play, discard all tokens from it and its owner (or the first player if that card’s printed type is objective-ally or ship-objective) takes control of the character (and all attachments on it). It loses the enemy card type and regains its printed card type. If a printed character with turncoat leaves play, it is placed in its owner’s discard pile (even if that player has already been eliminated). If that card’s printed type is objective-ally or ship-objective, it is instead removed from the game.

The encounter deck loses control of it (and all attachments on it) and a player specified by the relevant card effect takes control of it (and all attachments on it). The printed enemy loses its printed enemy type and gains the ally card type (with [willpower] equal to its printed [threat]). While a printed enemy has turncoat, its text box is considered to be blank (except for Traits). If a printed enemy loses turncoat while it’s still in play, discard all tokens from it and the encounter deck takes control of the printed enemy (and all attachments on it). The printed enemy loses the ally card type, regains its printed enemy type and engages the player who was controlling it. If a printed enemy with turncoat leaves play, it is placed in the encounter deck discard pile.

A: Even though a hero or ally that gains turncoat loses its hero or ally card type, it still remains a printed hero or ally and can be referenced as such by card effects. The same is of course true for an enemy. It’s also a way for us to more clearly reference a card when explaining rules and writing FAQs. Q: Does a printed enemy with turncoat also gain a sphere? Can I play attachments on it? A: Unless an effect explicitly tells otherwise, a printed enemy with turncoat does not gain a sphere or a cost. They are considered to be neutral for game purposes. You can play attachments on a printed enemy with turncoat as long as it is eligible for the attachment, but note that, since it’s now considered an ally, the limit of 2 restricted attachments per character will still apply. Q: Can I use a printed enemy with turncoat to pay the cost for a card like A Very Good Tale? A: Yes, you can exhaust a printed enemy with turncoat to pay for the cost of A Very Good Tale, but note that such a card has no cost so it will likely result in a mediocre tale.

Can I trigger something like Valiant Sacrifice off an ally “turning” on me? A: A character or an enemy that gains turncoat does not actually leave play. It remains in play and shifts allegiance, with a change to its card type and controller. Q: Can a card have two instances of turncoat? And if so, what happens? A: A card cannot have two instances of turncoat, so if an effect would add the turncoat keyword to a card that already has it, that effect cannot be resolved. Q: What happens when an enemy that is guarding an objective or a player card with Guarded (X) gains turncoat? A: When a player takes control of a printed enemy with turncoat, they also take control of all attachments on that printed enemy. This can be helpful for many objectives with the Guarded keyword (though note that you have not claimed those objectives since the objective is not technically “free of encounters”), but might be an issue for the Guarded (X) player cards, since they will end up attached to an ally and not to a hero.

They warmed their bones with delicious soup and cheered their spirits by singing songs together, until the strange horrors of their day wandering through the Old Forest seemed like distant memories. Early the next morning, they arose and planned their next move. Goldberry drew the young farmer a map of a safe route back to his farm, while the rest of the heroes decided that–having traversed so deep into the Old Forest the previous day–the closest inn was actually straight through the other side of the forest in the small town of Bree. They thanked Tom and Goldberry for their hospitality, and set off. It was almost dark when they arrived at the sign of the Prancing Pony, the finest inn Bree had to offer. They chose a table near the front, and caught the innkeeper’s eye as they arranged their travel gear. He was a kindly looking fellow, round in both the belly and the face, with a thick blonde-grey beard. “Good evening gentlefolk, Wheaton Butterbur very much at your service. More and more of you arriving every day, I should say. Not that I mind of course,” and at this the

Most welcome, of course.” The heroes exchanged quizzical looks, but before they could say anything, the look on his face changed from veiled concern to relieved embarrassment. “Or, perhaps I have misjudged! Never mind me, running my mouth when I’d better keep it shut. You know, my ole father always used to tell me that running the Pony was enough to drive a man mad and so it is. Will you folk be needing a room? Perhaps a spot of ale and something to eat?” The heroes replied in affirmation and Wheaton scurried off to the kitchen. As they waited, the heroes set to talking. “Something odd is going on here,” one said. “Perhaps once we have finished our meal we can have a look around town and find out more about this Gaur.” The others nodded in agreement.

These sets are indicated by the following icons: Last Gasp Last Gasp is a new timing trigger that functions as a Forced ability and appears on some enemies who are dangerous even in death.

He rubbed a sore shoulder as he held out a grimy hand to each of the heroes in turn. “Many thanks for saving me back there. The name’s Jack; folks around here call me ‘Wolfsbane Jack’ on account of my trade. Used to be ‘twas only animals that I hunted, but of late it’s not just the wild wolves that threaten Bree.” At this he gestured towards one of the slain men in a purple cloak. “We may have driven them out of town, but their defeat tonight will only force them to move swifter towards their goal.” “And what goal is that?” asked one of the heroes, her voice heavy with concern. “I’ll tell you all I know on the road,” said the man. “Gather your things and meet me outside the West Gate.” The story continues in “Fangs in the Dark”, the second Adventure Pack in the “Fell Summer” cycle.
