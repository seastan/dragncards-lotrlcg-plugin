Mustering of the Rohirrim Difficulty level = 7 Like all grand conspiracies, it had begun with a man tossing in his bedsheets, his mind swirling with half-remembered grudges and rotten chunks of envy. It was midnight in Aldburg and the old lord rose from his bed; he had not slept. He stood before a rack of armor: an empty shell, long shed. He was a warlord born to a time of war. A sword born bloody, and sheathed before its time. No longer. For all the kingsblood which ran through his grandfather’s veins, war was his only inheritance. His blade was polished. In the dim of his bedchamber, while a solitary candle dripped and quavered, Ealdwulf accepted the truth. He girded himself in the broken armor of his godsire, Prince Haleth, the Red Stallion. He lashed a buckler to his tired, creaking arm.

Our pact  remains unfulfilled. Return the land of green  hills to my people, as you have oathsworn.  Grimrede.” The hillmen would have their Gift. And Ealdwulf would have his crown. The ragged party stopped along the footpath outside the Glittering Caves. There, bereft of hope, slumped the traitor Gálmód. “My heart is troubled,” he said. “I have looked in the eyes of a wraith and seen, I fear, my own fate.” “You have much to answer for,” said a hero. “A great oath has been broken.” “I have told you everything,” said Gálmód. “Of Ealdwulf’s bargain with the Dunlendings. His plan to cede territory in equal trade for hillmen spears and archers and blood. I sympathized with them. This is their land, by all rights. Every learned man knows of the purges, the routs, and the cruel feud. Their claim is the elder. To displace them was wrong. To live this way, unconscionable.” “But war!” cried the hero. “War on your own kin! You

I begged of the king. Only Ealdwulf proved a sympathetic ear to the hillmen’s plight. I did not know, fool that I am, how he intended to use them – to use me. Now he has ensnared the Raven Clan chieftains with promises of land and steel and glory. As always, the cruelest warlords will rise to the top and the smallfolk will be slaughtered, Dunland and Eorling alike. I do not forswear the cause of the Dunlendings, but this war is beyond all wisdom.” “The war may be over before it can begin,” said another hero. “Ealdwulf’s forces mass along the Isen. All the while, the armies of Rohan are abroad, hunting orcs and scouring for Gálmód Worm-heart.” “Then we must gather them,” said Gálmód. “I beg you. Don’t let the Old Wolf lure Dunland along the path of blood.” “As oaths fall aside, we must hold to ours with all our heart,” said a hero. “Let us muster the horse-lords. We shall ride to Edoras over the white peak of Írensaga and across the great grass sea. We shall rally those who still hold true to honor. Then we will ride to the halls of Ealdwulf and make him see reason, though my heart fears it is too late to turn him from this road.”

The assassins lay fallen, their impotent blades strewn about their bodies. “Ealdwulf has departed,” said a hero, “his halls empty but for a catspaw and a killer. Would that they had turned their wiles to feeding a village or chasing off horse thieves.” “And while we rode, Ealdwulf wriggled across the Isen,” said another. “War is inevitable.” “A battle is inevitable,” said the last. “But if Ealdwulf Oathbreaker is captured and his ancestral claim renounced as folly, we may yet forestall the worst of it. I would not see brother slay brother in service of one old man’s greed.” “Then we must ride,” said the hero. “For Rohan’s great tapestry is affray, and the bitter lord would rend it all with one last tug. Let us ride, servants of the Mark, for the keeping of our oath will see the crowning of our honor.” The story continues in “Blood in the Isen”, the sixth Adventure Pack in the “Oaths of the Rohirrim” cycle.
