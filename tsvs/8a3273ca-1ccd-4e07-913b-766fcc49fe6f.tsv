The devoted keyword appears on some player cards in this cycle. While each non-[baggins], non-[fellowship] hero you control shares at least one Trait with a card with the devoted keyword, that card does not require a resource match. The Trait that is shared does not need to be the same for each hero. For example, an ally with the devoted keyword and the Gondor and Scout traits may be played without a resource match if all of your heroes have the Gondor trait, all of your heroes have the Scout trait, or some of your heroes have the Gondor trait and the remainder have the Scout trait.

Difficulty level = 5 The funeral in Lossarnach had been a somber affair. Within the confines of a family mausoleum, surrounded by kin and the vassals of her departed father, Morwen Steelsheen had not wept. She was a queen, stoic and tall, of the blood of Númenor. She remained by the tomb seven days and seven nights, a black gown and belt of white chrysanthemum her only adornments.

The last was a noble of Rohan, a man called Gálmód, who had been her close friend and advocate in court since her arrival many years ago. When her vigil had ended and the last of the mourners departed, only then did Morwen Steelsheen allow a pang of sadness to cross her face. Then she kissed the cold, white stone of her father’s sarcophagus, straightened herself, and emerged into the chill of an autumn morning. The honor guard followed close behind, joined by a column of Gálmód’s mounted Rohirrim. It was this band which ventured from the Vale of Flowers toward the borders of Rohan, where Morwen’s king – and kingdom – awaited. “You must be pleased to return home, my lady,” said one of the heroes. “Home,” said the queen. “I dare not linger on the thought. In my years I have dwelt on the shores of Belfalas and the green valleys of Lossarnach, yet now when I think of home I think only of the tapestries hanging in Meduseld. Of warm mead and kindly kin. Of Rohan, of the tribe of horse-lords which have so well

The group stayed an evening in the great city of Minas Tirith, where the aging steward feasted Morwen and her companions. In the morning they continued on, but they had not yet traveled a league before they were hailed by a lone rider on the road. “My queen,” said the rider, lowering his hood. “Thorongil,” said Morwen, embracing him. “Long has it been since you graced our halls at Edoras.” “I come with ill news,” he told her. “What have you seen, ranger?” asked Gálmód. “Orcs come down from the mountains?” “Aye, orcs and strange men.” “Phaw,” said Gálmód. “Foolish warnings from foolish wanderers. The queen has men enough to ward off mere ruffians.” “I thank you for the warning, master ranger.” Morwen

The ranger spurred his horse and continued at a trot toward the white city of Minas Tirith. Days later, the party had finally rounded the bend in a long road and now journeyed with the Drúadan Forest at their left shoulder. Before them stretched the broad, grassy lands of Anórien. One of the heroes gripped the bow slung across the horn of her saddle. “Thorongil’s warning perplexes me. We should shelter in the encampment at Erelas for the night.” “My men shall scout ahead,” said Gálmód. He signalled one of his captains, and the Rohirrim set off toward the bald green hill of Erelas and the encampment in its shadow. Gálmód remained behind. He tugged at his hauberk and clenched the pommel of his sword. “My queen,” he said, but he soon fell silent. As the day wore into evening, one of the heroes frowned. “Your scouts have not returned, Gálmód.” “Indeed,” said the noble. “Something must have delayed them in Erelas. It is not far now.”

The heroes caught the flicker of a torch, a manlike shape loping into the shadow of a barn and disappearing. “Something’s not right,” said Morwen. As she spoke a dark bird swept over the crossroads, soaring high, streaking through the moonlight and descending in an arc. But it was not a bird. It was an arrow, one of many, darkening the air. “The queen!” cried Gálmód. “Protect the queen!” He wheeled his horse, blade high and flashing as the flock of arrows came, followed by voices, howling in a strange tongue the words for blood and gold and fire. “Ambush at Erelas” is played with an encounter deck built with all the cards from the following encounter sets: Ambush at Erelas, Rohan Weather, and Rohan Encampment. These sets are indicated by the following icons:

Some cards and abilities refer to an enemy’s or objective’s loot pile. A loot pile is a faceup pile of player cards placed next to that enemy or objective. Cards in a loot pile are not in play and are under no player’s control. Cards in a loot pile are considered blank, except for their cost, sphere, and card type. Note that an enemy or objective with 0 cards in its loot pile still has a loot pile. Looter is a new keyword that appears on enemies in this quest. After you engage an enemy with the looter keyword, place a random card from your hand and the top X cards of your deck into that enemy’s loot pile. This is done every time an enemy with the looter keyword engages a player, even if there are already cards in that enemy’s loot pile.

Queen Morwen knelt before the captured enemy. “What wickedness brings you to this place?” she asked. The ringleader smirked. He muttered something. “He speaks the tongue of Dunland,” said one of the heroes. “Dunlendings this far east? Surely they would have been spotted.” “He curses us!” said Gálmód. “The cur besmirches the very name of Queen Morwen.” “No,” said one of the heroes. “I can almost make it out. He’s saying-” Then Gálmód unsheathed his dagger and flew with a frantic brutality onto the Dunlending, plunging his blade into the prisoner’s heart. “Gálmód!” The heroes dragged away the furious nobleman, his limbs flailing wildly.

He was telling us where they plan to strike next.” “Not strike,” said another. “Struck.” There need be no more words. Morwen stood, her face mottled with ash and blood and soil. She looked to the hilltop in the distance and saw the dark shapes of men working furtively, half-masked by the haze of night. “Erelas,” she said. “The beacon. They’ve captured the beacon.” Difficulty level = 7 Racing toward the hill of Erelas, the heroes felt a surge of fear. The beacon atop the hill had been guarded by only a token force, hardly enough to handle a surprise attack like this. What had long stood as a signal of peace and safety was now crawling with Dunlendings. Soon the heroes had left behind the encampment and began the arduous climb up the hill. Here and there the hill was girdled by a narrow stair carved in stone, but elsewhere the pathway had fallen into disrepair, and

The heroes and their companions climbed chiefly in silence. “What could they want with the beacon?” mumbled Gálmód, his back hunched as he climbed a rocky slope toward the beacon. “Nothing good,” said one of the heroes. “It is used as a signal between Minas Tirith and Anórien. While it is captured, any call for aid or warning of attack would be long-delayed.” By the time they arrived at the edge of the beacon’s platform, the heroes could overhear their enemies conversing brokenly in the language of the Rohirrim. One of the heroes raised her head to peer into the darkness over a crumbling balustrade. A crew of scowling Dunlendings were addressing a Rohirrim rider wearing a helm with a white plume. The Rohirrim kept one hand on the pommel of his blade. “You are late,” he said. “Trouble in the camp below,” said one of the Dunlendings. “You straw-heads put up a fight,” said another. “And you dealt with them?” said the Rohirrim. “Dead.”

Signalling a cadre of his fellow warriors, the rider strolled past the Dunlendings. “Make it look convincing,” he said. “Treachery among the ranks,” whispered the hero. “They shall pay with their lives for turning against kith and king,” said Gálmód. “May the blood of Eorl rebel against their very veins. Let us take the hill and light this valley with the death-pyres of traitors.” “Calm, Gálmód.” One of the heroes notched an arrow. “It is more important to hold the beacon than to seek revenge.” “Then prepare yourselves,” said Gálmód, drawing his sword. “For true queen and honored kin.

He began to fold it. “This is not over,” he said. “Rogues,” said Morwen. “We must return to Edoras at once.” At this, one of Gálmód’s riders spoke up. “This brings the reason for our delay, my queen. On our scouting, we intercepted a messenger from Aldburg. He brought word that an orc-host has crossed the Anduin and begun raiding in the Eastfold.” “Just as Thorongil warned,” sneered Gálmód. “Perhaps the ranger bore some wisdom after all.” “Then we must make haste to Aldburg,” said Morwen. “For our wick is now burning from both ends.

The Eastfold looked just as it did in the tapestries of Edoras and the Books of Kings: pleasant, pastoral, and vast. The riders bent their heads into the wind and urged their steeds onward, for they had received word from Gálmód’s scouts that an orc-host had crossed the Anduin and begun marching toward the city of Aldburg. Worse yet, they seemed to be raiding horse farms on the way, strengthening their numbers with heavy war horses and butchering those who stood in their path. “I grow concerned,” said one of the heroes. “Orcs assault the countryside just as wild-men strike at the border.” “Aye,” said another. “The realm of the horse-lords is caught between the forge and the fire.” “We shall seek aid at Aldburg,” said Queen Morwen. “Éomund is the Marshal there. He is young and brash, but valiant. He will surely supply us with aid.” “We may not have time,” called one of the heroes. “Look ahead!” He pointed toward a pillar of smoke

Turning to witness the clamor, one of the orcs shouted to the others – “Go get Thruk!” he bellowed. “Thruk’ll spike ‘em dead!” “We must have caught them on their way back to the main force,” said Morwen. The captured horses were gorgeous, saddled for war, bodies strong and elegant in the light of morning. “Flinthoof! Brightmane!” called Gálmód. “The king’s own horses. But where is their liege, Felaróf the Mighty?” The orc hefted his mass onto the stallion called Flinthoof.
