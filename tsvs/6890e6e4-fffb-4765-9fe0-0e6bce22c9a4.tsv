Blood in the Isen Difficulty level = 9 The enemies of Rohan gathered upon the far bank of the Isen. There they amassed, wild-haired Dunlendings from the clans of the Boar, the Wolf, and the Raven. There they sharpened their axes and scarred their flesh and howled in fell ritual. There among the rocks and rills crossed the traitor Ealdwulf, misbegotten prince of a forgotten royal line. There the hooves of his stallion splashed on the fords, and there behind him filed his riders: a grim cavalry of oathbreakers, of second sons, of those born without honor and those who had willingly cast it aside. The traitor looked upon his armies, the hillmen and the horse-lords, and he frowned. “Grimrede,” he said. “The time of your destiny has arrived.”

We fight for the home you have promised. Nothing less could bring together the three clans.” “My destiny, then,” said Ealdwulf. “The destiny of my forebears. The line of Haleth restored at last.” “I see through you,” said Grimrede. “You have no sons. You are an old man. You do not want to rule. You want to conquer.” “And what of your son?” said Ealdwulf. “What of your snarling little boy? Do you not wish him to lead the Raven clan after you have perished?” Grimrede shook his head. “Turch has not chosen his clan. Soon, the spirits will reveal themselves to him and he will choose his path. Amid the hills we have no care for the blood of kings. Lord Son of Lord, King Son of King. We follow our own ways – the ways of spirit and bone.” “Bone or blood, iron or gold. I care not. Win me this kingdom and you shall have a place in it. A Gift, long overdue, from one great lord to another.” The warlord Grimrede went into the camp. There he consulted with his shamans, the bearded ones who found omens amid knucklebones. There they dispensed

Before they could see it, the heroes heard the burbling waters of the Isen. At the head of his army, King Thengel of Rohan spoke with great solemnity. “We are nearing the borders. Ealdwulf and his men will move soon. We are riding on the eve of war.” “As a gardener plucks a weed, so will we stop Ealdwulf. Before the roots of his treachery further strangle this land.” The traitor Gálmód walked behind in shackles. “Grimrede refuses to march across the fords until the spirits deem it so,” he said. “They will not march without the approval of the moon.” One hero pointed up at the night sky, where a great yellow moon hung like a pendant. “It seems the moon has given his answer.” “Then we have little time,” said Gálmód. “War is upon us. Please, unchain me. Place a dagger in my hand and let me fight to right my wrongs. If not for my honor, then for the honor of my house. I do not wish for my son to be raised the child of a coward.”

You are a prisoner, nothing more.” Gálmód grimaced. “Perhaps. Yet upon the battlefield I will not be parted from my king and his course.” The king did not reply. The band rode on. They rode to the shores of the river Isen where they heard the drums of battle and the chattering of men prepared to die. The heroes drew their weapons. “We must cross the fords,” said one. “The warlord and his conspirator await just across the stream.” The shoreline swarmed with Dunlendings of three clans, and the valley echoed with wolf-cries, the shouts of ravens, the squeal and growl of a mighty boar. Blades glinted. The sun began to rise. Pacing the water’s edge, shoulders decked in dirty leather, was the chieftain Grimrede. “He is waiting for us,” said Thengel. “Our mighty foe.” “Then to battle!” cried a hero. “For Rohan! For oath and honor!”

(Dunlending Warriors can be found in the Children of Eorl deluxe expansion.) These sets are indicated by the following icons: Like a coney run down by baying dogs, Ealdwulf seemed small, nearly pitiable. Thrown from his horse, he was now nothing more than a sneering old man. A misguided, venomous thing. A fool. His guards dispatched, his stallion panting by the stream with great dark nostrils and a curling cloud of steam. The knees of Ealdwulf’s trousers wet and streaked with dirt. But he was not empty-handed. “Put down your sword,” said one of the heroes. “Come peacefully. Your folly has caused enough pain.”

Great Haleth wielded it as a prince of Rohan. As do I.” The others gathered about Ealdwulf in a circle. The heroes. King Thengel in gleaming armor. Gálmód in chains, panting, disheveled. In the chaos of battle he had escaped his guards and ridden to the king’s side. “Perhaps your blood made you a prince,” said Thengel. “But you are no man of Rohan. You will die on the banks of the River Isen like a common brigand. An orc. A poacher of horses.” “Do not taunt me, cousin.” Ealdwulf raised his blade and for a moment he was again a great warrior. He moved with the speed and grace of a man half his age, raging toward King Thengel in a blur. “The king!” cried Gálmód. “Protect the king!” He staggered between the two, his chains held high and flashing as the blade came. Gálmód was slain. Then Ealdwulf. The war was ended. Thengel sunk to his knees. He cradled Gálmód in his arms. The king’s face was streaked with bitter tears. “Break his shackles,” he said. “Break Gálmód’s shackles. He died a man of Rohan.”

The funeral in Edoras was a somber affair. The hero Gálmód was laid to rest amid a field of simbelmynë. The women sang songs for him. New songs and old, of tricksters turned heroes. Of lost children returning home. His son was among the mourners. Young Gríma watched pensively. He had heard the whispers of the Rohirrim these past weeks – that his father was stupid, easily ensnared by an enemy of Rohan. He resolved to make no such mistake. The king placed his hands on the child’s shoulders. “You shall stay with us at Meduseld,” said Thengel. “Weep while you may. Keep your heart full for him, and words of his good deeds ever upon your tongue. You will be raised the son of a champion, and the ward of lords. As a man of Rohan shall you live and die.” The boy felt a pang of spite for the king and his issue. Spite for the lordlings and ladies of the Golden Hall. For the heroism and valor for which his father died. Then he felt the king’s hands upon his shoulders. The anger cleared from his face, and for a moment he was

Across the hills and mountains there was a second funeral. The corpse of chieftain Grimrede was laid upon the bier while his shamans cast bones and watched the skies with dreadful expectation. Ravens wheeled above, hungry. Soon they would descend and feast until nothing of Grimrede remained but bone. Such was the way of the Raven Clan. The others had dispersed without ceremony. The Wolves in bloodied pelts descended first, and the Boars followed in turn. Young Turch watched them all go. His father’s alliance broken like clay on stone. “They will be at each other’s throats again.” Turch turned to see who had spoken – beside a dying fire, there crouched a man. A thin fellow, his flesh pale as the moon. At his waist he wore a belt of skulls. Upon his head he wore a helm of jagged antler and boar’s tusk. He prodded the embers with a stick. Turch felt cold. “There is only one way to unite the clans,” said the figure.

Our goal for these scenarios was to continue the tradition of varied and exciting challenges set by FFG. Developing the first complete cycle has brought its own set of challenges to us in ALeP as well. Nobody on the leadership team had undertaken this kind of endeavor before, and we didn’t quite know where to begin. But thanks to the excellent benchmark given to us by the FFG design team, we had a pretty good idea of where we wanted to end up, and over the first year of ALeP’s life (beginning September 2019) we started assembling all the pieces we thought we needed. We began with an overall design vision, which was to make something that feels like it could be an official product, and which was aimed at veteran players who already had a large card pool. We did not want to

In order to get our content to match with players’ existing card pools, we spent countless hours honing the card templates so that they would look just right, and developed a custom extension to the popular Strange Eons plugin to further improve the results. Many hours were also spent researching third party printers to recommend and making many experimental print runs until we were happy with the detail and color. In addition to making the cards look as close to official as possible, we also followed the Deluxe + 6 Adventure Pack model from FFG that long-term players would be familiar with. Each cycle of course has a theme, so for the theme of this cycle, we took a look at past cycles from FFG, and saw that there had been cycles that featured mono-sphere cards (Against the Shadow), multi-sphere cards (Dream-chaser), and multi-trait cards (Haradrim). So we decided to round this out with a cycle that focused on mono-trait cards. The mono-trait focus led us to a couple of major design decisions. First, we would set our story for the cycle in a time period slightly earlier than FFG’s when the various races and factions were more insular and had not yet come together against the growing shadow.

As much as we tried to adhere to FFG’s precedents, we did feel that some departures were necessary. We decided early on that the player cards would be released in a more synergistic way than FFG’s traditional model. Cards that work well together would all appear in the same set rather than spread throughout the cycle. At ALeP, we don’t receive any money for the content we produce, so we felt this strategy would be more friendly to players who are only interested in one or two different archetypes. It also meant that players would not have to wait for the cycle to be complete in order to realize the full potential of the new archetypes we were introducing. Speaking of player card archetypes, we made a conscious decision to focus in this cycle on certain traits that we felt did not quite meet their full potential in the official card pool, like Rohan and Beorning. We introduced many cards for these archetypes, some of them quite powerful, so that they could adequately compete with (but not outshine) many of the other archetypes established by FFG. Hundreds of playtesting hours were spent trying to get this balance right, and

When it came to traits that we felt were already well-established, such as the Noldor, we felt it was unnecessary to push them to any new heights. Instead, we focused on giving them a more fully realized alternate mode of play, which in the case of the Noldor meant improving the “top-of-the-discard” archetype. We felt this was in keeping with FFG’s method of developing mining-style cards for the dwarves rather than continuing to strengthen their swarm mechanic. FFG is known for building a brand new trait archetype over the course of a cycle, such as Ent, Harad, Dale etc. We wanted to keep this tradition alive by expanding the Bree trait. We didn’t have much to go on from FFG’s side apart from the Barliman Butterbur ally, but we nevertheless took that ally’s seed of “undefended attacks” and tried to make it grow. We felt that it made sense for the Bree archetype to be particularly resilient to these types of attacks, as they have no standing army and would be largely defenseless if invaded. We hope you found this style of play fresh, exciting, and a little risky!

We are equally proud of the accompanying quests that all have their unique feel and challenge thanks to the roster of different encounter designers. Each quest designer was given complete creative control over their quest, and we hope that you feel that they all managed to produce quests that felt very different, while still adhering to the overarching story for the cycle. When it comes to the playtesting and game balance of both the player cards and the quests, it cannot be understated how important our software team has been. Thanks to a highly advanced data pipeline, we now have a system where all the card data lives in a spreadsheet, and when a change is made to a card attribute, or a new card is designed, a notification is sent to that card’s channel in the ALeP Discord, highlighting what text had changed, and a new card is generated and available for playtest in DragnCards within minutes. If a card was added or removed from a quest, that encounter deck gets updated as well. This has helped us achieve a state of iterative design that we believe rivals, if not exceeds, most industry tabletop design processes. We hope you have been happy with the quality of content from ALeP so far. And we hope you stay with us for the long-extended future!
