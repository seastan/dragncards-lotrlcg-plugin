Rules & New Terms Attribute Tokens Attribute tokens are a new class of tokens that affect a card’s stats. There are different kinds of attribute tokens, such as [threat] tokens, [attack] tokens, etc. If a card has X tokens of a given attribute on it, it has +X of that attribute. For example, if an enemy has 3 [threat] tokens on it, it gets +3 [threat]. Attribute tokens are not removed from a card unless it leaves play, or you are otherwise instructed to remove them.

They represent additional priorities or optional goals that heroes may be pursuing during the game. They are considered to be both player cards and objective cards. Player objectives are immune to encounter and quest card effects and are under no player’s control. At the end of Setup (see the online ALeP FAQ for more details), the players as a group may put into play one (and only one) player objective from their collection(s). Add it to the staging area with Side A faceup and trigger its Setup effect. The Setup effect on Side A allows players to “opt in” to the objective before it flips to Side B. During the game, a player may trigger the effects on a player objective if, and only if, they opted in to it. Some effects on a player objective may require exhausting it (which an opted-in player can do even though they don’t control it). Exhausted player objectives ready at the beginning of the refresh phase, at the same time as all other player cards in play.

A: At any point of a game, if the players do not share a common staging area, remove any player objective from the game. Q: Are player objectives considered unclaimed or unguarded objectives for quests like Escape from Dol Guldur or The Storm on Cobas Haven? A: Yes, though keep in mind they are immune to encounter and quest card effects. For example, while a player objective would cause Spider of Dol Guldur to surge, it could not become guarded by a Siege Ship. Last Gasp Last Gasp is a new timing trigger that functions as a Forced ability and appears on some enemies who are dangerous even in death. When an enemy with the Last Gasp trigger is destroyed, the engaged player (or the first player, if that enemy was not engaged with any player) must trigger that enemy’s Last Gasp effect. Note that no enemy featuring this trigger appears in the scenarios of The Shire’s Reckoning, but it will be used in the upcoming Fell Summer cycle.

In fact, if she didn’t do something very soon to turn things around, her entire week—or even her whole year—would be ruined. You see, Mayor Pott himself had assigned her the very solemn duty of organizing this year’s Overlithe feast in Hobbiton. This was a prestigious honor—much more important than stuck-up Lalia Clayhanger’s mid-year feast. After all, Mid-year’s Day happens every year, while Overlithe comes around only once every four. As such, it was obviously very important that Lobelia’s feast be bigger and better than Lalia’s in every way—she needed to arrange for fancier decorations and more food than Lalia could possibly hope to pull together. That’s why she was all the way out here in Michel Delving with less than a week to go: Old Bolgo baked the best pies in all the Shire, and Lobelia would settle for nothing short of the best. “The quantity isn’t the problem Lobelia,” Bolgo was saying, “The problem is the delivery. My sons are out in the countryside right now, and with my bad back I couldn’t possibly make the trip down to Hobbiton. Plus, I hear they caught some Big Folk ruffians snooping

But you and Otho can come pick them up—” Lobelia cut him off. “Impossible! I am needed in Hobbiton already, to make the final preparations for the feast.” Bolgo gave a helpless shrug as Lobelia pivoted angrily on her heel, her face red. Not far away, her eight-year-old son, Lotho, played near the road. “Stop right there!” he shouted, brandishing a stick at several passing strangers. “I’m a Shirriff, and that means whatever I say goes! And I say this road is closed!” The strangers looked at each other with bemusement. “Well then,” one of them said, a twinkle in her eye, “How ever are we to get to Bree? You don’t know another way around, do you, young Shirriff?” At this, Lobelia’s ears perked up and she hurried over. “Headed towards Bree, are you?” she asked, trying to sound sweet and welcoming, but unable to conceal the request on the tip of her tongue. “You’ll have to pass through Hobbiton on your way, then.” “Yes,” one of the strangers said, “we were headed that way, though this lawman here has informed us that the road is closed.” At this he winked at the small boy. Lobelia paid him no heed and continued. “It just so

A shipment of pies, brought from Old Bolgo’s here to the Hobbiton Party Tree in time for Overlithe, five days hence.” She thought for a moment, at war with herself about her next offer. “I suppose it’d only be proper to invite you to the feast as well. It’s to be the finest feast the Shire has seen in years!” The strangers looked at one another, weighing their opinions by the looks on their faces. Then one spoke. “I suppose we’re in no hurry. And it would be lovely to see the best of The Shire’s hospitality before we’re on our way.” The others nodded in agreement. “Perfect,” Lobelia said, rubbing her hands together. “I’ll make the arrangements!” “Pies for the Party” is played with an encounter deck built with all the cards from the following encounter sets: Pies for the Party, Distractions, and Ruffians. These sets are indicated by the following icons:

She didn’t even notice the arrival of the heroes until they were nearly upon her. “Ah! Finally decided to show up. And not a moment too soon, too, I was beginning to worry I’d put my trust in the wrong sorts of folks,” she said, hastily gesturing towards where to put them. “They do smell wonderful, though. Bolgo does some great work—if I didn’t know better, I would say they were fresh from the bakery no more than an hour ago!” The heroes glanced at one another nervously, nodding in agreement. What Lobelia didn’t know wouldn’t hurt her! They silently agreed: their trip to the Hobbiton bakery would forever remain a secret.

The heroes, feeling they deserved a reward for their harrowing efforts delivering pies, quickly began the difficult work of enjoying all the party had to offer. They were instant celebrities, with drinks being pushed on them and requests from the young Hobbits in attendance to tell them tales from lands far away. The heroes happily obliged, telling stories of brave men and women in cities of stone, of kingdoms built in great forests and those carved from the bedrock of the earth. “Can’t say that I’ve ever had a call to go see all that,” one particularly grumpy Hobbit named Farmer Chubb interjected, “Furthest I’ve gone is to the other end of the Marish for a chicken delivery. Ended up staying for a few days in the town of Bree. Didn’t care for what I saw there, and don’t care to see much more,” the farmer said, giving a curt nod and returning his pipe to his mouth for a long slow pull. “Funny you should mention it,” one of the heroes replied, “for we are heading towards Bree next week.” Farmer Chubb leaned in, “Indeed? You wouldn’t mind doing this old farmer a favor on your way would’ya?

But ya see, I owe young Farmer Maggot some chickens. I don’t suppose I could impose on you to bring them to his farmstead in Bamfurlong?” The heroes agreed, and made plans to set out after breakfast the following morning. The festival ran late into the night. All the patrons enjoyed bountiful food, song, and drink. Some among the heroes’ group, unaccustomed to the generosities of a Hobbiton party, overindulged themselves, realizing it only when the sun rose bright and early the next day, and a rooster’s cry urged them from their beds. Shuffling to the gathering room of the local Inn, the heroes ordered a quick breakfast, trying to muster the motivation to stick to their plan to depart early for their two day journey, with a stop in Woodhall. “I don’t think it’s as far as all that,” one of the heroes says, slowly rubbing their eyes. “We could sneak in a quick nap before we head out, enjoy a nice second breakfast, and then be in Woodhall before Supper.” “There’s no rush. Why not spend the morning here, have a luncheon in town, and then depart?” “You heard Farmer Chubb,” one of the heroes

If both the Wolf deck and the Wolf deck discard pile are empty and you must reveal a card from the Wolf deck, the players as a group must discard 1 character from play instead.

The wolves, unwilling to follow them into the town itself, broke off their pursuit. The heroes pounded on the dark door of an inn. “Who’s that at this time of night?” A disgruntled voice called, followed by the sound of slow footsteps. A stout middle aged Hobbit answered the door. “Apologies for the intrusion. May we rent a room for the night? We come on an errand for Bamfurlong, but more urgently we seek the safety of your inn.” Another howl sang out to emphasize the hero’s point. “Best do that,” the innkeeper said gruffly, stepping back and beckoning the heroes inside. “Been getting real dangerous at night.” “That was more than just dangerous,” one of the heroes replied, as they fished in their pack for some bandages. “We found several lumberjacks out of Woodhall dead in Woody End. Then we were ambushed by wolves with a cleverness that felt strategic.” “Well, you have nothing to fear in my care. Come, let’s

Secrets of the Old Forest Difficulty level = 6 Scenario Design: Salted Pork The heroes awoke just before dawn, feeling cramped and irritable from a night’s rest in Farmer Maggot’s farmhouse broken by howls of wolves. They shuffled downstairs to find him already at work preparing breakfast. The young farmer greeted his guests warmly, though they could see from the weary look on his face that he too had endured a sleepless night. “Thank you again for bringing those chickens to me,” he said as he retrieved several plates from a cupboard, “They’ll replace those I lost the past few nights. Though, truth be told, if something isn’t done about these wolves I may not be able to keep the farm at all.” The heroes exchanged grim looks. “Are wolves not a normal sight in the Shire?” one asked. “Not in these numbers, no.

But these wolves, why, there’s something queer about them.” The farmer leaned over the table, as if to share a secret. “They came from the Old Forest. I saw a whole pack of them not a week ago leaving the treeline and swimming across the Brandywine River, yelping and yowling as if something terrible were after them. What do you suppose could scare a whole pack of wolves right into the river?” The heroes exchanged quizzical glances. “Trolls?” “I don’t rightly know,” the young farmer admitted, “but there’s definitely something out there. I’ve seen the way my hounds watch the forest at night, and I’ve heard the strangest sounds during the day, a creaking and groaning carried on the wind as if the trees were in pain. I plan to head out there today, take a look around. If there’s anything that may be solved with a well-aimed bow, I plan to do it. Otherwise…” he trailed off. “Allow us to accompany you, master Maggot,” one of the heroes spoke. “Our journey takes us in that general direction anyway, and if there are indeed trolls out there, then there is safety in numbers.” Farmer Maggot nodded appreciatively. “I’d be most grateful.

Taking their lives will not heal you. Your enemy has gone from this place. Release these people, and go to sleep!” He gave the great poplar tree a sharp look, one hand on his hip.

My house is near!” Slowly, the heroes stood, dusted themselves off, and followed the strange man further into the woods. It had been their strangest day in the Shire yet, and their adventure was only getting stranger. The story continues in “Strange News in Bree”, the first Adventure Pack in the “Fell Summer” cycle.
